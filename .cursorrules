# Cursor Rules for ASCII Frog Project

## 🚫 CRITICAL GIT RULES - NEVER VIOLATE
- **NEVER COMMIT OR PUSH** unless the user explicitly asks to do so
- **NEVER PUSH TO MAIN BRANCH** - Always use feature branches
- **ALWAYS ASK PERMISSION** before any git operations (add, commit, push)
- **FOLLOW RELEASE.md WORKFLOW** - Use feature branches and PRs only

## 🚀 RELEASE RULES - MANDATORY CHECKLIST
When user says "release":
1. **FIRST**: Commit and push all current changes
2. **ANALYZE**: `git diff main..HEAD` to determine version type
3. **DETERMINE**: patch/minor/major based on commits with `feat:`, `fix:`, `BREAKING:`
4. **FINAL STEP - MANDATORY**: Run `npm version [patch|minor|major]` 
5. **PUSH VERSION**: `git push origin [branch]`
6. **VERIFY**: Ask user to confirm version bump is correct
7. **NEVER skip steps 4-5** - Version bump must be the final release step


## Auto-fix suggestions
- When I have missing imports, suggest adding them at the top of the file
- When I ask to "fix imports" or "add missing imports", scan the file for undefined variables and suggest appropriate import statements
