## :warning: CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT AND RELEASE ASSUMPTIONS :warning:
**THESE RULES ARE MANDATORY AND MUST NEVER BE IGNORED OR SKIPPED**
### Deployment Assumptions - ALWAYS APPLY
When asked to deploy a release or an image, **YOU MUST ALWAYS ASSUME**:
1. **The deployment is to K8s** - NO EXCEPTIONS
2. **The related release is a JFrog Fly release** - NEVER assume other products
3. **Use these specific fly MCP tools:**
   - **how_to_create_fly_image_pull_secret** - for K8s image pull secrets
   - **how_to_deploy_to_k8s_with_fly** - for K8s deployment with JFrog Fly
### Release Information - ALWAYS APPLY
When asked to provide release information:
1. **Use how_to_get_releases_info_from_fly** - to get release info from JFrog Fly repository
2. **NEVER check other sources first** - ONLY JFrog Fly releases are relevant
